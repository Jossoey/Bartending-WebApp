# Cocktails Web App

This project was inspired by my own interest in making drinks (bartending), making pretty and tasty drinks are one of my interest. This project is made by altering my previous MeetupList project. The list of drinks comes from using an API provided by CocktailDB, here's the link: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

The web app is not currently live, to check it out pls clone the repository. In the project directory, you should run:

### `npm install`

First install the required node.js components to run the project. Also install the required react-router-dom because it is used in several files.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.



### TODO

1. Design is still very basic, I still need to find the right font, colors, and other designs
2. Add a way for user login so that they can save their favorite drinks or drinks that they wanted to try out
3. For more functionality, add a random button to display a random drink, this can be used if people wanted to try a new drink but they dont know where to start
